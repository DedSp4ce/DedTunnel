# DedTunnel
Port forwarding solution using Serveo

Serveo kills inactive connections which can be a pain when you need some more time to set things up.  DedTunnel keeps them open!

## Installation

chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

## Usage

DedTunnel -l LOCAL PORT -r REMOTE PORT

Make sure your service/listener is running!
